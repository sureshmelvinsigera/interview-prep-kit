# Git Starter

## What is Git ?

Git is an open source distributed version control system

---

## Initiate git for a project

There are two ways to initialise git for a project

- By running git init command in project base directory

```
> git init
```

- By cloning existing repo using git clone

```
> git clone https://github.com/iamvickyav/preparation.git
```

Once Git is initiated in the project, a hidden folder called **.git** gets created inside the project base directory

## Saving your changes in Git

Saving your changes is nothing but doing a git commit

## Stages of a file
Untracked: the file exists, but is not part of git's version control
Staged: the file has been added to git's version control but changes have not been committed
Committed: the change has been committed
